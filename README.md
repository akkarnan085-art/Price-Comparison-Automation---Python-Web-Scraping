# Price-Comparison-Automation---Python-Web-Scraping
This project compares the prices of similar products from two online supermarkets — Laughs Supermarket and Glomark Supermarket. The Python script extracts price information directly from the given product web pages using web scraping techniques, and determines which store offers the cheaper price at the time of execution.
